= Wireplay Hooks =

Wireplay has a built in hook/plugin subsystem through which external plugins can register with the core. Wireplay has a Ruby Hook System built into it using which hooks can be written easily in Ruby.

The general idea about writing hooks in C can be best illustrated by walking through the Ruby Hook Plugin (src/whook_rb.c):

{{{
/* define the hook object and assign appropriate call back functions */
static struct w_hook rb_hook = {
   .name    = "ruby",
   .init    = rb_w_hook_init,
   .start   = rb_w_event_start,
   .data    = rb_w_event_data,
   .stop    = rb_w_event_stop,
   .error   = rb_w_event_error,
   .deinit  = rb_w_hook_deinit
};
}}}

As you can see, Wireplay supports the following events:

 * init: When the hook is initialized
 * start: When new TCP connection is made with the target
 * data: When data is about to be sent to the peer
 * stop: When the connection is closed
 * error: When an error occurs
 * deinit: When wireplay is cleaning up

{{{
/* Finally, register the hook descriptor with the core */
w_register_hook(&rb_hook, &rb_hook_conf);
}}}
